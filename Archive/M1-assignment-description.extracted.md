Milestone 1: Data Pipeline - Blackboard Assignment
### Description
Course: QM 2023: Statistics II / Data Analytics
Due: Wednesday, February 25, 2026 by 11:59 PM
Points: 50 (25% of capstone grade)
Submission: Team submission (one per team)
### Overview
Build your capstone project's foundational data infrastructure by integrating your primary dataset (REIT
returns by default, or your approved alternative) with supplementary economic/market data into a clean,
analysis-ready panel dataset.
Real-world context: Professional analysts spend 60-80% of their time on data engineering. A robust pipeline
ensures all subsequent analysis runs smoothly and reproducibly.
### What You're Submitting
1. GitHub Repository Link
Required: Submit the URL to your team's GitHub repository (created via GitHub Classroom).
### Example: https://github.com/Dr-Seagraves/qm2023-capstone-team-name
Your repository should contain all M1 deliverables (see below).
### Repository Structure
Your capstone repository should follow this modular structure:
### QM-2023-Capstone-Repo/

Data Pipeline Flow:
1. Fetch scripts (fetch_*.py) → Download/load data → Clean → Save to data/processed/
2. Merge script (merge_final_panel.py) → Combine processed datasets → Save to data/final/
Required Deliverables (in your GitHub repo)
1. Python Scripts (Modular Pipeline)
Multiple fetch scripts — One per dataset:
code/fetch_reit_data.py (or your primary dataset)
code/fetch_fred_data.py (or your supplementary data)
Additional fetch_*.py scripts as needed
One merge script:
code/merge_final_panel.py — Combines all processed datasets into final panel
Requirements:
Must run without errors using relative paths only (via config_paths.py)
Clear section headers and comments
Prints before/after row counts and summary statistics
2. Root README.md (Project Overview)
### Location: Repository root
Must include:
Team members and roles
Research question (1-2 sentences)
Dataset overview (primary + supplementary sources)
Preliminary hypotheses (3+)
How to run the pipeline (step-by-step)

3. Final Dataset: data/final/[dataset_name]_analysis_panel.csv
Clean panel dataset in long format (Entity × Time)
Shows outcome variable(s), entity characteristics, and 10-15+ supplementary variables
No missing keys; properly merged; ready for regression analysis
4. Data Dictionary: data/final/data_dictionary.md
Dataset overview (N entities, N time periods, date range)
Variable definitions table (variable, description, type, source, units)
Cleaning decisions summary
5. Data Quality Report: M1_data_quality_report.md
Comprehensive documentation of:
Data sources (primary + supplementary)
Cleaning decisions with before/after counts and economic justification
Merge strategy and verification
Final dataset summary with sample statistics
### Reproducibility checklist
Ethical considerations (what data are we losing?)
6. AI Audit Appendix: AI_AUDIT_APPENDIX.md
Documentation of all AI tool use following "Disclose-Verify-Critique" framework
Required: Missing AI Audit = automatic 0/50 points
### What You Should Have Ready
By this milestone, your team should have established:
✅ Your Dataset: Primary data source identified and loaded (REIT Master for default track, or approved
alternative)
✅ Supplementary Data: 10-15+ economic indicators, policy measures, or market factors integrated (FRED
API, custom sources, etc.)
✅ Research Direction: Preliminary research questions that will guide your M2 exploratory analysis and M3
econometric models
✅ Clean Data Pipeline: Reproducible script that handles missing values, outliers, duplicates, and merges
data correctly
✅ Panel Structure: Long-format dataset (one row per entity-time observation) ready for panel regression

Office Hours: Dr. Seagraves, Mon & Wed 3-5 PM (Helm 122-D)
### Questions?
Contact Dr. Seagraves via email (cayman-seagraves@utulsa.edu) or come to office hours. Don't wait until the
last day to ask questions about data sources, merge issues, or reproducibility requirements.
Remember: This pipeline is the foundation for your entire capstone project. Invest the time now to get it
right, and M2/M3/M4 will go much smoother.
