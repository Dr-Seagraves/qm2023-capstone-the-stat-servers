Milestone 4: Final Investment Memo
QM 2023 Capstone Project
Due: Friday, Week 14 (May 1, 2026) by 11:59 PM Points: 50 (25% of capstone grade) Format: Hybrid - Team
memo (40 pts) + Individual addendum (10 pts)
Overview
Milestone 4 is the culmination of your semester-long capstone project. You will synthesize your data pipeline
(M1), exploratory analysis (M2), and econometric models (M3) into a professional investment memo that
communicates findings to a non-technical audience.
Real-world context: Investment committees don't read code or regression output. They read concise memos
that translate technical analysis into actionable recommendations. Your memo must:
State findings clearly (Executive Summary)
Explain methods transparently (Methodology)
Present evidence visually and numerically (Results)
Provide investment guidance with honest caveats (Conclusions)
Success criterion: A portfolio manager with no econometrics background should be able to read your memo
and make an informed investment decision.
Learning Objectives
By completing M4, you will:
1. Translate technical results into business language
2. Communicate visually with publication-ready tables and figures
3. Provide actionable recommendations grounded in empirical evidence
4. Acknowledge limitations honestly (omitted variables, assumptions, external validity)
5. Demonstrate individual accountability through personal contribution reflection
6. Practice professional writing (clear, concise, jargon-free)
Deliverables
Note for Alternative Dataset Teams: Adapt the "Investment Committee" framing to your research context.
For example:
Crypto teams → "Risk Committee" (e.g., "We recommend reducing DeFi exposure during regulatory
uncertainty periods")
Housing teams → "Policy Advisory" (e.g., "Markets with X characteristics are most vulnerable to rate
increases")
Macro/economic teams → "Economic Outlook" (e.g., "Our model forecasts Y under scenario Z")

Open Data teams → Frame your recommendations around whoever would act on your findings
(policymakers, managers, investors, etc.)
The core requirements (Executive Summary, Methodology, Results, Recommendations) remain the same
regardless of your topic. Where the template below says "Investment Recommendation," replace with the
appropriate action for your audience.
1. Team Memo: Final_Investment_Memo.pdf (40 points)
Format: 5-7 pages, professional PDF (not Word doc) Structure: See template in memo_template.md
Required Sections:
1. Executive Summary (0.5 page)
2-3 sentences stating the key finding
1-2 sentences with investment recommendation
No tables or figures (pure text)
2. Methodology (1 page)
Data sources (REIT Master, FRED, REIT Factors) with citations
Sample construction: n_reits, n_months, date range
Model specifications (equations for FE and DiD/ARIMA/ML)
Variable definitions (what is FEDFUNDS_lag2? What is MOM?)
3. Results (1.5-2 pages)
Table 1: Fixed Effects regression (main model)
Table 2: Alternative specification (DiD/ARIMA/ML)
Figure 1: Key visualization (e.g., sector returns over time, rate vs. return dual-axis plot)
Figure 2: Diagnostic plot (residuals vs. fitted)
Interpretation prose: "The coefficient on FEDFUNDS (-0.025) implies that a 1 pp increase in the
Federal Funds Rate reduces REIT returns by 2.5 pp, controlling for REIT and time fixed effects."
4. Conclusions & Recommendations (1 page)
Investment implications: Which sectors to buy/hold/sell?
Risk assessment: What could go wrong with this analysis?
Caveats: Assumptions, omitted variables, external validity concerns
5. References (0.5 page)
Data sources with URLs
Any academic papers cited (Lit-Anchor from Orbis)
Format: APA or similar
6. Appendix: AI Audit (0.5-1 page)
Summary of AI use across all milestones
Key verification and critique examples
2 / 7

## Page 3

2. Individual Addendum: Individual_Addendum_[YourName].pdf (10 points)
Format: 1 page PDF per student Content:
1. Personal Contribution (2-4 bullets)
What did you contribute to M1, M2, M3, M4?
Be specific: "Led M1 data cleaning, handled missing values and merge logic (15 hours)" not
"Helped with data"
2. One Defended Decision (2-4 sentences)
Choose one methodological decision you made (or advocated for) and defend it
Example: "I recommended using a 2-month lag for FEDFUNDS based on M2 lag analysis showing
strongest correlation at lag 2 (r = -0.38). This choice is grounded in economic reasoning: REITs
negotiate leases and financing over 1-2 months, so immediate rate effects are muted."
3. One Key Limitation (2-4 sentences)
What is the most important limitation or caveat of your analysis?
Example: "Our Fixed Effects model assumes parallel trends across sectors, but M2 EDA showed
slight pre-shock divergence between Retail and Industrial REITs. If this trend continued absent
the rate hike, our DiD estimate may overstate the causal effect."
4. AI Audit Notes (if applicable)
Any AI use specific to your work not covered in team appendix
Team Memo Template
See memo_template.md for full template. Key guidance:
Executive Summary
2-3 sentences: key finding (magnitude, significance, lag). 1-2 sentences: specific recommendation (e.g.,
"Overweight Industrial by 15%; underweight Retail/Office"). Write for non-economists—no jargon.
Methodology
List data sources with citations. Sample construction (n, date range, observations after cleaning). Model
equations with variable definitions. Standard errors clustered at entity level.
Results
Table 1: Main FE regression (coefficients, SEs, t-stats, p-values; FE and N; significance stars). Table 2:
Alternative spec (DiD/ARIMA/ML). Figure 1: Key viz (e.g., dual-axis outcome vs. driver). Figure 2: Diagnostic
plot. Reference figures with ../figures/filename.png when memo lives in results/reports/.
Interpretation: translate coefficient to economic magnitude; note robustness and theory alignment.
Conclusions & Recommendations
3 / 7

## Page 4

Investment implications: Sector allocation (who to overweight/underweight), factor tilts, scenario analysis.
Risk assessment: Model assumptions, omitted variables, external validity. Caveats: FE/DiD assumptions, data
limitations. Be specific and honest.
Individual Addendum Template
See individual_addendum_template.md for full template.
Personal Contribution: 2-4 bullets, tasks + hours per milestone (e.g., "Led M1 data cleaning, FRED merge (20
hrs)").
Defended Decision: One methodological choice with evidence (e.g., lag choice based on M2 EDA +
economic reasoning).
Key Limitation: Substantive caveat with why it matters.
AI Audit Notes: Any AI use not in team appendix; document prompt, output, verification.
Grading Rubric (50 points)
See rubric.md for detailed breakdown. Summary:
Component Points Criteria

12 Tables/figures publication-ready; economic interpretation clear
Interpretation
Team Memo:
Recommendations & 8 Actionable advice; honest limitations
Caveats
Individual Addendum 10 Specific contribution; defended decision; key limitation; honesty
Total: 50 points
Reproducibility note: M4 is submitted as PDFs, but grading still expects your existing capstone code (M1
scripts + merge, M2 notebook, M3 capstone_models.py or equivalent) to run and to match the numbers
and figures in the memo. You are not graded on new code written only for M4; you are graded on whether
the documented analysis is reproducible from the team repository. Details: rubric.md (Reproducibility &
Technical Rigor).
Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them
Pitfall 1: Executive Summary is Too Technical
4 / 7

## Page 5

Problem: "We estimated a two-way fixed effects panel regression with clustered standard errors..." Solution:
Write for a business audience. "We analyzed 500+ REITs and found that rising interest rates reduce REIT
returns."
Pitfall 2: No Investment Recommendations
Problem: Memo ends with "Results show negative correlation" (so what?) Solution: "Based on these findings,
we recommend overweighting Industrial REITs and underweighting Retail REITs."
Pitfall 3: Ignoring Limitations
Problem: Memo claims results are definitive with no caveats Solution: "Our analysis assumes parallel trends,
which may be violated if pre-shock trends differ. A placebo test partially addresses this concern."
Pitfall 4: Vague Individual Addendum
Problem: "I helped with coding and analysis" (no specifics) Solution: "I implemented the M3 Fixed Effects
model, ran VIF diagnostics, and drafted the robustness checks section (18 hours)."
Pitfall 5: Tables are Unreadable
Problem: Regression output copy-pasted from Python console (raw text, no formatting) Solution: Use
markdown tables or export to CSV → format in Excel → save as PDF

6 / 7

## Page 7

Use Week 14 hackathon meetings (Mon/Wed) to draft the memo and rehearse slides.
Finish a submission-ready PDF before 11:59 PM Friday, May 1; do not rely on post-presentation edits
for the graded artifact.
If you present on May 1, finalize talking points early that week so memo and deck stay consistent.
Tip: Draft your Executive Summary and Conclusions first—they map directly to your presentation script.
Good luck! Your capstone memo is the portfolio piece that demonstrates your analytical rigor and
professional communication skills.
